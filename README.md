## NHL_Single

### Purpose
This is a script for scraping and parsing the play-by-play, roster and shift files available for an NHL game in order to generate tabular and visualized data.

### Prerequisites
This script requires Python (3.0 at minimum, 3.6+ is recommended) in order to run the script. If you don't already have Python on your machine, the simplest remedy is to install the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda Distribution</a>. 

If you intend on taking advantage of the script's Twitter functionality, you need to create a <a href="https://apps.twitter.com/app/new">Twitter application</a> and request its Access Token.
